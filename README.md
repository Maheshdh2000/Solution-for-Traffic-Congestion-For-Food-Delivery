Real Time Traffic Congestion Solution 
1) We can install sensor which albe to captue images of live traffic and time taken by traffic to cross each intersection .The sensors on each of these junctions were collecting data at different times, hence we will see traffic data from different time periods. Some of the junctions have provided limited or sparse data requiring thoughtfulness when creating future projections. Based on this data we can predict how much time it will take to cross intersection. Also we can comapre with the congestion shown by Google Map.
i have attached one python file where i build a model using Prophet. Prophet is procedure for forecsting time series data based on an additive model where non liner trends are fit with yearly, weekly and daily seasonality, plus holidays effects. I performed Predictive analytics to identify daily or seasonal traffic patterns in specific regions. Adjust driver routes or delivery windows based on these patterns, avoiding high-traffic areas at peak times.

2) Foldable Electric Bike for Transportation:
Envoirenmental Sustainbility
Efficiency and Time saving
Cost Saving
Help to access congested roads
Electric Bikes can reduce delay

3) Hire Trained and Proficient Diver
Train Driver according to Traffic Congestion Situation
It Should be physically fit.
Offer drivers extra pay for taking alternate, less congested routes that may slightly extend their distance but reduce overall delivery time in traffic.
